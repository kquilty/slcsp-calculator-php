To run:  php slcsp.php

NOTES:

    - I wrote this in PHP since that is what I'm most comfortable with.
        Other options I considered:
            - python
            - node / typescript
            (I'd be happy to do it in either of these as well)

    - The file names are hardcoded for simplicity and were left with their original names in case those were important.
